EXP NO:21 C PROGRAM TO CREATE A FUNCTION TO FIND THE GREATEST NUMBER
Aim:
To write a C program to create a function to find the greatest number

Algorithm:
1.	Include the necessary header #include <stdio.h>.
2.	Use a series of if and else if statements to compare the values and return the maximum among them.
3.	Declare variables n1, n2, n3, n4, and greater to store user input and the result.
4.	Use scanf to take four integers as input.
5.	Call the max_of_four function with the input integers and store the result in the greater variable
 
Program:

#include <stdio.h>

int max_of_four(int n1, int n2, int n3, int n4) {
    int max = n1;
    if (n2 > max) max = n2;
    if (n3 > max) max = n3;
    if (n4 > max) max = n4;
    return max;

int main() {
    int n1, n2, n3, n4;
    printf("Enter four integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &n1, &n2, &n3, &n4);
    int greater = max_of_four(n1, n2, n3, n4);
    printf("The greatest number is: %d\n", greater);
    return 0;

EXP NO 25: C PROGRAM TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN A      SENTENCE



Aim:

To write a C program that counts the number of words in a given sentence.

Algorithm:

1.	Input the sentence: Take a sentence from the user.
2.	Initialize a counter variable: This will keep track of the number of words.
3.	Process each character of the sentence:
o	Iterate through the sentence, checking each character.
o	If a character is not a space, it may belong to a word. If it's the first non-space character after a space or at the start, increment the word count.
4.	Handle spaces and punctuation: Skip over spaces, punctuation marks, and consider each word as a sequence of characters separated by spaces.
5.	Display the result: After processing the sentence, output the total word count.



Program:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int count_words(char *str) {
    int count = 0, in_word = 0;  
    while (*str) {
        if (isspace(*str)) {

        } else if (!in_word) {
            in_word = 1;
            count++;
        }
        str++;
    } 
    return count;
